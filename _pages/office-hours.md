## 📅 When?

### January 12th, 2024, 02:30 PM Central Time (US and Canada) https://time.is/compare/230pm_12_January_2024_in_CT

## ℹ️ How? (UPDATED: **January 4th, 2024**)


## :question: What?

The goal is to work on some open-source work projects (some code, docs, and community) with a small group. 

All you need to do is bring something that you want to work on. 

We are all remote so it's a nice excuse to have some office banter and talk to people we may only know online. 

## ℹ️ Rules

- 👍 Join because you want to work on something with a small group

- 👍 Be mindful and respectful of everyone's time. 

- ⚠️ No marketing your product or service

- 👍 Be mindful of the [Python Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/)
