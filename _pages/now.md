## Location

### 🏡 Lawrence (KS, USA)

It's Winter 2026 in Lawrence, KS. Football season is almost over but basketball is in its prime. We are getting ready for a long winter and I'm enjoying video games with my kids and spending time with my family until winter break.

  Some days, I write code, work with AI, train developers, automate systems, secure websites, and manage humans.

- I am working on several side projects and logging my progress on [wip.co][] for public accountability.
