**Location:** Lawrence, KS

**Working on:**

- I am a month into a stay-at-home order here with my family in Kansas with at least two weeks left. Daycares closed a month ago, but we are doing just fine.

- I work full-time [REVSYS][]. Some days I write code, train developers, automate systems, secure websites, and manage humans.

- I am working on a weekly newsletter called [Django News][].

- I am working on [DjangoCon US 2020][].

- After a few year hiatus, I am trail running again. Checkout out my [#jeffisrunning][] tweets on Twitter.

- I have maintained a weekly [personal goals project][] on GitHub since late 2015. I stalled out a bit in 2018, but it's on my radar to automate, and keep going.

- I co-wrote a series of articles on [OpenSource.com][] every month in 2018 with [Lacey Williams Henschel][].

- I am working on several side projects and logging my progress on [wip.chat][] for public accountability.
