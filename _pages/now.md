I'm home in Lawrence, Kansas. It's spring.

- I work full-time [REVSYS][] as a Partner, Engineer, and Consultant. Some days I write code, train developers, automate systems, secure websites, and manage humans.

- We are working on [DjangoCon US 2019][].

- After a few year hiatus, I am trail running again. Checkout out my [#jeffisrunning](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23jeffisrunning&src=typd) on Twitter once the weather is warmer.

- I converted to a [Keto diet][] and lost ~45 lbs before gaining back 10 lbs.

- I have maintained a weekly [personal goals project][] on Github since late 2015. I stalled out a bit in 2018, but it's on my radar to automate, and keep going. Currently off-track(ish).

- I co-wrote a series of articles on [OpenSource.com](https://opensource.com/users/jefftriplett) every month in 2018 with [Lacey Williams Henschel](https://opensource.com/users/laceynwilliams).

- I'm attempting to blog more often in 2019 after having a great streak in 2017. I fell off my goal in August.

- I am working on several side projects and logging my progress on [wip.chat](https://wip.chat/@jefftriplett) for public accountability.

- ~~I dabble with the Ukulele.~~

- ~~I'm an avid basketball fan and [Is the Lead Safe][] if my website for tracking real-time game updates. I hope to resume working on it during the fall.~~

- I continue to watch [television][] and listen to [podcasts][].
