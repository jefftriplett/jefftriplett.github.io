**Location:** Lawrence, KS

**Working on:**

- I work full-time at [REVSYS][] for some fantastic clients.
  Some days I write code, train developers, automate systems, secure websites, and manage humans.

- I am working on a weekly newsletter called [Django News][].

- I am working on [DjangoCon US 2021][]  for this October.

- I am working on [Django Packages][].

- One of my 2020 and 2021 regrets is that I never ranâ€”checkout my [#jeffisrunning][] tweets on Twitter.

- I have maintained a weekly [personal goals project][] on GitHub since late 2015. I stalled out a bit in 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 but it's on my radar to automate and restart.

- I co-wrote a series of articles on [OpenSource.com][] every month in 2018 with [Lacey Williams Henschel][].

- I am working on several side projects and logging my progress on [wip.chat][] for public accountability.
