**Location:** Lawrence, KS

- I work full-time [REVSYS][] as a Partner, Engineer, and Consultant. Some days I write code, train developers, automate systems, secure websites, and manage humans.

- We are working on [DjangoCon US 2019][].

- After a few year hiatus, I am trail running again. Checkout out my [#jeffisrunning][] on Twitter once the weather is warmer.

- I converted to a [Keto diet][] and lost ~45 lbs before gaining back 10 lbs. This is still a work-in-progress.

- I have maintained a weekly [personal goals project][] on GitHub since late 2015. I stalled out a bit in 2018, but it's on my radar to automate, and keep going.

- I co-wrote a series of articles on [OpenSource.com][] every month in 2018 with [Lacey Williams Henschel][].

- I am working on several side projects and logging my progress on [wip.chat][] for public accountability.

- ~~I dabble with the Ukulele.~~

- ~~I'm an avid basketball fan and [Is the Lead Safe][] if my website for tracking real-time game updates. I hope to resume working on it during the fall.~~

- I continue to watch [television][] and listen to [podcasts][].
