## Personal

I prefer Apple hardware. I have an iPhone 14 Pro, Watch Series 8, iPad Mini (2021), and an iPad Pro 12.9" (2015), and they are great.

## Coding

I'm working on a MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019) with 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 with 64GB memory.

## Editor and Terminal

- My main text editor is Sublime Text 4.
- I occasionally run VS Code as a full-screen terminal to use devcontainers and the debugger (le sigh).
- I use [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) for my terminal.
- I mostly use Google Chrome (le sigh).
- Most of my configs are in my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/jefftriplett/dotfiles)

## Desktop Apps

- Alfred with Power Tools.
- I back up my machines with Time Machine and Backblaze.

## General

I have both an office in downtown Lawrence and a home office, and I do my best to mirror both environments since we live in a hybrid world.

## Office and Home Office Setup

- My desk is a Jarvis Bamboo Standing Desk
- My chairs are [Ikea Markus]() :thumbsdown:
- Apple Magic Keyboard
- My mouse is a cheap Amazon Basics (bought in bulk)
- I run three external displays.
  - Three 27-inch Dell monitors.
  - Various 30-inch and 27-inch Monoprice monitors.
- CalDigit TS3 Dock
- Anker 10-port USB-3 USB switch

## Other Gear

- Backpack
- Travel Router?
