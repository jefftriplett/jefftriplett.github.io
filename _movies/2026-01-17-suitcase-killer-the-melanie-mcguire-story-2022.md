![](https://walter-r2.trakt.tv/images/movies/000/793/300/fanarts/thumb/44bebcb1d5.jpg)Based on a shocking true story, Melanie McGuire was an exceptional fertility nurse, married to her ex-Navy husband Bill and doting mother of two boys. When she falls for Brad, a doctor at her clinic, and gets entangled in a steamy love affair, Melanie does the unthinkable. After drugging and murdering Bill, she dismembers him and places the body parts into three suitcases, throwing them into Chesapeake Bay. But when the suitcases are found on the shores of Virginia Beach, an investigation is launched leading to Melanie as the prime suspect. Led by the efforts of assistant attorney general Patti Prezioso, authorities eventually bring Melanie to justice, who despite being convicted, continues to maintain her innocence.
