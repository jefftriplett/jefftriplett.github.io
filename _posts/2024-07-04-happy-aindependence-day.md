To everyone in the United States, Happy Independence Day and Happy AIndependence Day to everyone else.

In the spirit of staying ahead of the game and ensuring our online security, I came across this article by Cloudflare, [Declare your AIndependence: block AI bots, scrapers and crawlers with a single click](https://blog.cloudflare.com/declaring-your-aindependence-block-ai-bots-scrapers-and-crawlers-with-a-single-click).

Iâ€™m already using Cloudflare on several domains, and I enabled the AI Scrapers and Crawlers blocking features on [Django Packages](https://djangopackages.org), [Django News Jobs](https://jobs.django-news.com), and several websites I managed.

If you wrote a scraper for Django Packages and are impacted by this change, contact me, and letâ€™s talk. We have an API, a better solution than spidering the website.
