A few weeks ago I was in Portland for PyCon US. The event is one of my favorites because it brings so many people from around the world together into one place for a week.

I used to head into PyCon with intentions of making it to dozens of talks, but that goes by the wayside as soon as I get the chance to go to lunch with a friend I haven't seen in awhile. Now, I attend prioritizing people over talks and I'm much happier with the overall experience. 
 
If you ever attend, I encourage you to leave your laptop at your hotel or Airbnb for the three days of talks and talk to as many old and new friends as you can. You won't be disappointed. After all, all of the videos are recorded so you can watch them from the comfort of your home or even on your flight or train back.
 
Since PyCon records everything and there are 140+ recordings, knowing where to start is daunting. Here are three lists of talks to get you started:
