This was written while driving to Chicago (technically from the passenger seat). Still, a few people contacted me and asked me how I vote for PSF directors, so I wanted to share.

If you can vote in the PSF election, please do so before **Tuesday, July 16th, 2024, 2:00 p.m. UTC**. For more details, check out their blog post, [The 2024 PSF Board Election is Open!](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/07/the-2024-psf-board-election-is-open.html) (The blog post lists the date incorrectly as ending on a Friday.)

I served on the PSF board for five years, from 2018 to 2023, and here is what I am looking for when I research who to vote for this year.

It‚Äôs a harder-than-normal slate of candidates because only three open seats are available, compared to four in the last few years. More candidates are new to me this year than most years.

We also have some solid candidates running, which makes it even harder.

Existing directors
------------------

For existing directors, I look at:

- How long have they served on the board?
- What positions/roles did they serve while on the board?
- What has the PSF accomplished during its term?
- What was their meeting attendance like?
- I read their previous candidate statements to see if the PSF accomplished what they said they wanted.
- How did they treat the PSF‚Äôs staff in meetings, at events, and behind the scenes?

All candidates
--------------

For everyone, including existing directors, I read their candidate statements, and then I look at:

- What do they value?
- What their company and community affiliations are.
- Understands and is committed to our Code of Conduct to promote a healthy community.
- What workgroups did they participate in?
- What are they committed to working on and changing in their next term?

What I‚Äôm prioritizing
---------------------

I prioritize diverse candidates and representation. This includes geographical representation.

I prioritize candidates who **do not work** for Big Tech / FAANG companies. These companies often give raises and promotions to employees who make it on open-source boards. It‚Äôs a KPI goal for some Dev Rels and I‚Äôm not here to help any Big Tech companies. Thankfully, I have served with many selfless directors, despite them working for Big Tech companies. Still, you have a right to know when you vote for someone if their position will check off one of their KPIs.

I prioritize the Python community‚Äôs needs over individual needs.

I prioritize candidates with a track record of getting things done over only showing up to be seen. (Yes, this is a thing.)

I prioritize practical communication skills. If you write over the heads of the community, then you could be more effective at communicating.

I‚Äôm looking for reform.
-----------------------

Overall, I am looking for reform. A few public mishaps by the board have damaged the community‚Äôs trust in the organization.

I want to see reform across those impacted workgroups, and I will prioritize candidates who show awareness of this. I considered listing them here, but ‚Äúwhat I‚Äôm prioritizing‚Äù when I vote is not up for public debate. I might write more on this later.

If you are running
------------------

If you are running for the board, thank you for putting yourself out there.
