If you havenâ€™t heard about [Black Python Devs](https://blackpythondevs.com), Juneteenth is an excellent day to learn about this organization and how to support it.

If you havenâ€™t heard about Black Python Devs, here is a quick overview:

> Black Python Devs was created by its founder Jay Miller after seeing a trend of the same handful of Black developers speaking at major conferences, taking leadership positions, and dealing with the same challenges towards burnout.
>
> [blackpythondevs.com/about/](https://blackpythondevs.com/about/)

I also want to share the goals of Black Python Devs:

> Our goal is to become the largest community of Black Python Developers in the world and establish our community as a source for diverse leaders in the greater Python community.
>
> We aim to:
>
> - Establish guidance, mentorship, and career support for Black Pythonistas around the world.
> - Create opportunities for the Python community to invest in local communities of Black Python Devs members
> - Increase participation of Black Python Devs members in existing Python community programs, events, and initiatives.
