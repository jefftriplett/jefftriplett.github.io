I am hosting Office Hours this [Friday, July 19th, 2024, from 2:00 pm to 4:15 pm Central Time](https://time.is/0200PM_19_July_2024_in_CT?Jeff%27s_Office_Hours).

‚û°Ô∏è I have to leave earlier than normal to pick up my kids, but I plan to be around until 4:15 pm to 4:30 pm Central Time or as time permits.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Anyone can join office hours.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Our office hours are a collaborative space where we can discuss our ongoing projects, catch up, and work together to wrap up our week on a productive note.

üíº I will be working on a new Django project this week, sourcing data for it, and hopefully writing a bunch of views.

üôè As always, everyone is welcome to join, whether you‚Äôre a regular attendee or joining for the first time.

‚úÖ If you need any additional details, feel free to send me a message or check out the gist from our previous sessions, where you‚Äôll find the Zoom link ‚ö†Ô∏è

I look forward to seeing everyone.
