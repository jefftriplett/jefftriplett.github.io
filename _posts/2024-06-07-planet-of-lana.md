My son and I started playing [Planet of Lana](https://www.backloggd.com/games/planet-of-lana/), a sci-fi adventure/platform/puzzle game about a young girl and her cat. They are on a mission to rescue her sister, who was abducted by an invasion of hostile alien machines. Itâ€™s fun; we have worked together to solve the puzzles.

We are playing on the Switch, and the game is 20% off in the [Nintendo Store](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/planet-of-lana-switch/).
