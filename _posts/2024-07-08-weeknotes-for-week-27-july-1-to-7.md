The last week was a blur between the holiday, travel, and cramming a lot of work. My notes this week are more glossed over than most

Family
------

We drove to Illinois (near Chicago) to see family this week. We had family from both coasts who we don‚Äôt see very often, and it was the first time much of the family met my youngest, Nora. It takes us 8 to 8.5 hours to drive there, and people are always amazed at how good my kids are at traveling these distances. They both love the extra screen time and are easy to travel with. We can hand each one an iPad, and they are set for hours, given enough snacks and a rest stop every few hours.

Work
----

It was a short two-day week, but I got a bonus third day of work between fitting a few hours in the car and half a day on Friday. This was nice because we are wrapping up an existing client project while ramping up on another project.

This has also made me realize that Django has many shopping cart projects, but they all seem to be outdated. We struggled to find a project we could use, which made me realize that the Django community is sorely missing a good shopping cart and checkout experience that works.

Community Work
--------------

[Djangonaut Space](https://djangonaut.space): All three Djangonaut Space Team Neptune members have made meaningful contributions early in the process, and now I‚Äôm feeling the pressure to detail and share some more advanced projects so they can have tasks for the duration of the project.

Django Code of Conduct WG: We have prioritized keeping up as we get new members used to contributing. This week, was a busy week.

Side projects
-------------

**[Django News Newsletter](https://django-news.com):** We shipped issue [\#240](https://django-news.com/issues/240#start).

[Django News Jobs](https://jobs.django-news.com): We have had code to aggregate some other Django job boards, and this week, we started allowing those to come through.

Writing
-------

This week, I was back on track, and I wrote and published something every day. It was my first day of giving myself a buffer so that I am always writing tomorrow‚Äôs post, which took the edge and pressure off. I am still writing every day, but with the holiday, it was nice knowing I didn‚Äôt have to fit it in on our last day in Chicago, which ended up being a really long, full day with family.

üì∫ [Presumed Innocent](https://trakt.tv/shows/presumed-innocent) - I watched the first five episodes, and it‚Äôs okay.

Next week
---------

It‚Äôs my first whole week back in a while. I‚Äôm looking forward to catching up and mowing my yard while listening to podcasts. I need to catch up on house stuff, including running my homemade above-ground sprinkler system. (Chill; we live near the Kansas River.)
