[Django Release Cycle](https://jefftriplett.com/django-release-cycle/) is based on [Dustin Ingram](https://github.com/di)'s [Python Release Cycle](https://python-release-cycle.glitch.me/). 

The goal of the project is to visually chart out Django releases along with their end-of-life dates based on data from Django's [Supported Versions](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/#supported-versions) documentation.

I built the first version as a [Glitch remix](https://django-release-cycle.glitch.me/) and later ported it over to GitHub Pages because it was easier to update.
