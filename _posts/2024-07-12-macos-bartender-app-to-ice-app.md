I upgraded my Macs to macOS Sonoma a few weeks ago. While everything has been uneventful, the Bartender app pinged me one too many times about upgrading to Bartender 5, which has several Sonoma-only features.

Last year, I looked forward to upgrading Bartender until their [recent botched communication and messaging](https://www.macbartender.com/Bartender5/blog/) regarding the purchase of the app.

[Oliver Andrich](https://mastodon.social/@oliverandrich@social.tchncs.de)â€™s [Week 23: An Almost Perfect Week](https://andrich.me/2024/06/%F0%9F%93%94-week-23-an-almost-perfect-week/) was the nudge I needed to go ahead and switch over to [Ice](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice), which is an open-source menu bar manager for macOS.

The upgrade took less than a minute, and the app worked the same way Bartender did for me. I changed the menu icon to an ellipsis to match what I had the Bartender app set to, and everything worked.
