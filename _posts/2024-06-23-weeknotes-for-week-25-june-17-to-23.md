Last week, my side of the family drove out to Colorado Springs, Colorado, and we rented a house for the week. The trip was great; seeing family was good, and watching the kids spend time with family they donâ€™t get to see very often was the highlight for me. The mountains were great, but I donâ€™t want to ride a train from 8k to 14k feet of altitude soon.

Family
------

The last of my biological aunts and uncles passed away two nights before we left Colorado. We had some other unexpected news, and I hope we have better news after the funeral this week.

Work
----

I took the whole week off, so the only work this week was community work.

Community Work
--------------

[Djangonaut Space](https://djangonaut.space): Week 1 kicked off, and we had our first team meeting. The meeting went well, and I have a follow-up meeting on Monday with one Djangonaut who couldnâ€™t make it.

General Python: I had a ton of messages from Python friends this week asking for advice on upcoming bylaws changes. I wrote up a few drafts, and I might get around to publishing one or the other.

Side projects
-------------

**[Django News Newsletter](https://django-news.com):** We shipped issue [\#238](https://django-news.com/issues/238#start).

[Django Packages](https://djangopackages.org): More small updates and more on this sooner.

I wrote a tool to export my Mastodon bookmarks. I tend to revisit these every day, and I wanted a way to create checklists for them and save them. I might find good content from the newsletter or posts I want to follow up on once I have more time.

Writing
-------

I wrote every day but only published for three days, including today. I wrote several drafts, but I mostly spent time with my family.

[2024-06-19](https://micro.webology.dev/2024/06/19/follow-black-python.html): **ðŸ’œ Follow Black Python Devs on Juneteenth** If you havenâ€™t heard about Black Python Devs, Juneteenth is an excellent day to learn about â€¦

[2024-06-17](https://micro.webology.dev/2024/06/17/djangonaut-space-has.html): **Djangonaut Space has begun** This is my first time helping out with Djangonaut Space as a Navigator for the Django Packagesâ€¦

Entertainment
-------------

ðŸ“º [Leave the World Behind](https://trakt.tv/movies/leave-the-world-behind-2023) - I rewatched half of this movie with my mother and sister.

ðŸ“º [Hellboy](https://trakt.tv/movies/hellboy-2019) - I didnâ€™t realize I had missed this one. I liked it even if I donâ€™t know much about the Hellboy story outside the other movies.

Next week
---------

I am returning to work a day earlier than planned, but it will be a long, short week.
