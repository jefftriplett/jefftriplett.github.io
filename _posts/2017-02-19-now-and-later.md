Last week I [wrote](/2017/now-page/) about my [Now][] page which I thought was a fun experiment.

I had no idea if anyone actually read my blog post outside of a few friends. To my surprise, several friends were also inspired and created their own Now pages.

I thought I'd highlight a few of these this week since I'm in the middle of trying to wrap up a few longer form blog posts. Enjoy!
