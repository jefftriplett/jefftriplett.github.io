Last week, [William Vincent](https://twitter.com/wsv3000) and I launched a new project the [Django News Newsletter](https://wsvincent.com/announcing-django-news-newsletter/). 

As Will points out, *"The Django web framework is used by millions of developers and billions of consumers, yet it does not have an active weekly newsletter."*

Our goal is to keep you in the loop in all things Django and Python including new releases, news, articles, projects, educational resources, tutorials, videos, and whatever else you need to know to stay in the loop of what's new this week.
