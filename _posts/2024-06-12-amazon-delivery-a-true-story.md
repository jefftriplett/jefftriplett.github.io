Amazon: Buy now and have it by 4 am, or pay $1.99 for garage delivery, which you donâ€™t have, or in a week.

The next day: Arriving sometime today by 3 pm.

3 pm: Still arriving by 3 pm.

4 pm: Arriving between 3 pm and 10 pm.

~7 pm: Arriving tonight by 10 pm.

The next day: Arriving today.

After it doesnâ€™t arrive: Arriving tomorrow by 10 pm.

If you made it this far, itâ€™s never showing up, and you should cancel because itâ€™s lost, and they will repeat this for a week until they cancel it.
