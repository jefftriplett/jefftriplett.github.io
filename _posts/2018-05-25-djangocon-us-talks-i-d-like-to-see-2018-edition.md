Continuing in the tradition of my [2017](https://jefftriplett.com/2017/django-talks-id-like-to-see/) and [2016](https://jefftriplett.com/2016/djangocon-us-talks-id-like-to-see/) "DjangoCon US Talks I’d Like to See" posts, here is an update for 2018.

Once again, our [DjangoCon US 2018 CFP deadline](https://2018.djangocon.us/news/cfp-open/) on June 3rd is approaching, and in case you need some inspiration, I wanted to share some talk ideas.

If public speaking isn't your thing or if you want to help [review proposals](https://2018.djangocon.us/news/call-for-reviewers/), we could use your help too. 
If you have a topic in mind that you'd like to see, [let me know](https://twitter.com/webology) and I'll add it to my list. 


## Who do we want to hear from?

Everyone brings a new perspective and voice to our program. 
We'd love to hear from passionate voices regardless of how long you have been in our industry. 

You don't have to be a Python or Django developer to submit a talk to us. 
In fact, some of our best talks each year come from outside of our community. 


## Pro-tip: Encourage someone to speak

Whether you submit a proposal or not, please consider encouraging someone else to submit a proposal. 
I have encouraged dozens of people to give first-time talks over the years, and it's one of the most personally rewarding experiences for me. 

If you encourage someone and have a story you'd like to share, please consider [reaching out to me](https://twitter.com/webology) and let me know. 


## What others want to see

Both of these lists are great, so check them out before you read about my ideas. 
There is probably some overlap here.

## Deep Dives

With the announcement that [Django: Under the Hood (DUTH)](https://www.djangounderthehood.com/blog/article/2018-02-27-letting-go/#blogcontent) has been sunsetted, I'd love to see more deep drive proposals in the same spirit that DUTH inspired. 

Maybe you want to propose a deep dive into a Core Django feature like caching, forms, generic views, the ORM, URLs (new path syntax), etc. and how they work? 

Maybe you want to propose a deep dive into a favorite third-party library like Django Channels, Django REST Framework, Wagtail, or one of the thousands that I missed? 

We have longer talk slots which are perfect for deep dives. 

## What's new in Django 2.x

These talks are always well received. 
I'd love to see a talk which gives an overview of what's new as a whole or a deep drive if the topic warrants it. 

Since there are too many of these to accurately list, here links to the release notes of what's changed since last year:

- Python 2.x support was dropped
- [New features in Django 2.0](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/2.0/#what-s-new-in-django-2-0)
    - [Simplified URL routing syntax](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/2.0/#simplified-url-routing-syntax)
    - [Mobile-friendly contrib.admin](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/2.0/#mobile-friendly-contrib-admin)
    - [Window expressions](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/2.0/#window-expressions)
    - [Minor features in Django 2.0](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/2.0/#minor-features)
- [New features in Django 2.1](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/2.1/)
    - [Minor features in Django 2.1](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/2.1/#minor-features)

## MOAR

- Mariatta Wijaya gave a great talk at PyCon 2018 about [What is a Python Core Developer?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhj7eb6TrtI&t=187s). 
  In that spirit, What is a Django Core Developer? 

- Having ran a large scale application successfully through Zappa and AWS Lambda, I'd love for someone to give talk about Zappa again.

- More GraphQL talks.

- I'd love to see a large scale Django case study.
  It has been a while since we have had a good case study, but maybe this year is a good year to bring one back.

- We haven't had a panel in a few years which is a shame because we have had some excellent ones.


## Django Community

- State of the DSF. 
  Last year we had a joint meet and greet for the DSF and PSF board members to say hi. 
  Maybe a state of the DSF by the DSF Board which is part-talk and part-panel where they can discuss goals and core values might be a good format.

- I would like to hear more from Django Core developers. 
  We have a lot of new attendees every year who want to help, and I think we are missing out by not having more Django Core devs on sight to interact with. 
  This could easily be a panel too. 

## What else?

I'm cutting my list short this year because many of the ideas I mentioned [last year](https://jefftriplett.com/2017/django-talks-id-like-to-see/) are still relevant plus Lacey and Sara covered a lot of ground. 

Feel free to [let me know on Twitter](https://twitter.com/webology) ) what you wish to hear, and I'll add them here like I have done in previous years.

Good luck!
