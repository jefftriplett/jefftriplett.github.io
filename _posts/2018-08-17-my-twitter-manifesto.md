This is more of a WIP than the ink being dry.

tl;dr My lingering thoughts about Twitter aka #birdsite for those on other networks.

I haven't decided if I'm going to participate in [#DeactiDay](https://twitter.com/monteiro/status/1028315475296452609) yet. 
~~I'm leaning towards it.~~ (I opted out.)
However, the platform is still too important for many marginalized and underrepresented voices. 
It takes a tremendous amount of privilege to participate and to pretend that this problem is easily solved by jumping over to [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/). 
Participating is a personal choice and I respect you all regardless.

## Things to consider

- [Sage Sharp's excellent thread](https://twitter.com/_sagesharp_/status/1030112338836221953) on why Mastodon comes with its own problems.
- [Making Twitter Tolerable, One Glitch App At A Time](https://medium.com/glitch/making-twitter-tolerable-one-glitch-app-at-a-time-ad3022abe2bc) lives up to the promise of "Making Twitter Tolerable." 
  I immediately put these Glitch add-ons to good use:
    - Disable All Retweets via [turn-off-retweets](https://turn-off-retweets.glitch.me/)
    - Return to Chronological via [follow-management.](https://follow-management.glitch.me/)
    - Keep Up With Your Followers via RSS via [Twitter Followings OPML Export](https://opml.glitch.me/)

## Short-term

- I am [@webology@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@webology) and [@webology@twitter.com](https://twitter.com/webology).

- All of my public Mastodon Toots are published on Twitter via [Moa](https://moa.party/).

- I am syncing my Twitter friends list via [Mastodon's Friends Bridge](https://bridge.joinmastodon.org/friends).

- I have filters setup to remove `from birbsite` and `@twitter.com` to avoid content republishing from Twitter to Mastodon. 
  After a week or two of seeing dozens of RTs in a row, this has made my overall experience better.

- My preferred UI is [Halcyon](https://notabug.org/halcyon-suite/halcyon) which is a Twitter UI clone which is written in PHP. <br>

  *Please note:* Filters do not seem to work here which I find annoying and I hope this is a bug which is fixed sooner than later.<br>

  If hosting your own PHP instance isn't your thing, I have found a great host on [twitter.rixx.de](https://twitter.rixx.de/).

- I prefer a Twitter-like UI than Mastodon's default TweetDeck-like experience. Thankfully, [Pinafore](https://pinafore.social/) is another web client which has a more Twitter-like feel to it.

## Short to Medium-term

- I am participating in [#BlockParty500](https://twitter.com/shannoncoulter/status/1028632688586936320) using this [Block Together app+list](https://blocktogether.org/show-blocks/Jegy0TDm2gypbK-Tg1vGTh5KCJY2mxq_6iJ_hK2p). I am also proactively blocking advertisers who appear in my timeline.

- I am working on a Telegram Bot which will publish to Mastodon, Twitter, both, or whatever else comes out.

Why Telegram? I have been on the platform for a few months and have reconnected with friends who might otherwise not be on most social media websites. Their bot platform is great and I am a member of a few communities which aren't possible on a platform like Twitter.

## Long-term

The writing is on the wall that I don't want to be on Twitter unless there is a management change.
