My favorite third-party video game hardware company, 8BitDo, announced its 11th-anniversary limited edition controllers, [SN30 Pro - Golden/Silver Limited Edition](https://www.8bitdo.com/sn30-pro-usb-limited/).

I have over half a dozen 8BitDo controllers (and even a keyboard), my favorites, and what we pick up when my family wants to game on our Switch or iPad.

I wanted the SN30 form factor but have yet to order one. I donâ€™t know if a metal, wired controller will fit into my library, but they tempt me.
