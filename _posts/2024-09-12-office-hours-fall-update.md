This Friday, I am hosting Office Hours before I travel to [DjangoCon US](https://2024.djangocon.us) (organizer) and the [Black Python Devs Leadership Summit](https://blackpythondevs.com/leadership-summit-2024/) (speaker) in Durham, NC.

High-level details
------------------

‚ÑπÔ∏è Anyone can join office hours. Many join because they work remotely, miss seeing faces, and miss the random conversations when a small group hangs out.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Our office hours are a collaborative space where we can discuss our ongoing projects, catch up, and work together to wrap up our week on a productive note.

üôè As always, everyone is welcome to join, whether you‚Äôre a regular attendee or joining for the first time. If you are curious, reach out.

‚úÖ If you need any additional details, feel free to send me a message or check out the gist from our previous sessions, where you‚Äôll always find the most recent Zoom link ‚ö†Ô∏è
