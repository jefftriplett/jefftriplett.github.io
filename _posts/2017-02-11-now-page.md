I added a [Now][] page to this site, which is inspired by [Aaron Sumner's Now page][], which is inspired by [Derek Sivers's][Derek Sivers] [Now Page Movement][]. 

An "about" page tells you about the background of the person behind the website. 

A "now" page tells you about what the person is focused at this point in their life. 

Checkout my [Now][] page and I'd encourage you to add one to your website too. It's a fun exercise and a great way to keep up with people you haven't seen in a while.
