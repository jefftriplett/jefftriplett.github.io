I no longer trust or believe in Mozilla, so I deleted Firefox from my machines this weekend.

<div class="highlight">```shell

</div>There was no one decision, but [Firefox version 128‚Äôs Privacy-Preserving Attribution](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/privacy-preserving-attribution) update was the final straw.

The default browser you use is a personal decision, and I have always kept Firefox around. It was my default for over a decade until I gave up and switched to Google Chrome. At that point, Firefox became bloated and buggy like the Mozilla browser before it, and I found myself at that intersection again.

Last year, I switched to [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com) as my [default browser](https://micro.webology.dev/2024/04/27/drop-google-chrome.html) and only kept Chrome around for a few organizations. Eventually, I‚Äôll delete Chrome, too, but that‚Äôs more symbolic of removing Google from my life.

What annoys me the most is that Mozilla was supposed to be the company that knows better, but their leadership keeps reminding [us](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/16/16784628/mozilla-mr-robot-arg-plugin-firefox-looking-glass) [of](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363424/mozilla-layoffs-quarter-staff-250-people-new-revenue-focus) [who](https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/22/24109116/mozilla-ends-onerep-data-removal-partnership) <a href="">they</a> [are](https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/24/mozilla_product_chief_sues_over/).

Removing Firefox pains me because I believe in alternative browsers that aren‚Äôt controlled by one company. I have friends who have worked for Mozilla in the past and present.

Had Mozilla pledged to cut the bullshit and give me a Firefox Pro option to support them, I would have been one of the first to sign up. However, I don‚Äôt trust Mozilla when they aren‚Äôt focused on being the best web browser in the industry. I‚Äôd rather avoid their antics until they give me a reason to trust them again.

PS: Maybe [Servo](https://servo.org) is a better alternative from Mozilla, but for now, [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com) is my best Chrome-like, and it‚Äôs not run by Google until something better emerges.
