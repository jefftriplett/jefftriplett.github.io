*I’m running a week behind on this.*

This week was our first week back home without traveling in a month, and it felt good to be home. I had time to catch up on mowing the yard, and I treated the yard with an eco-safe mosquito repellent. Despite the hot weather, Sunday felt nice outside to be mosquito-free.

I rolled my above-ground sprinkler system A few years ago, and I still need to install and run it this year. I wanted to get it this weekend, and here we are.

Family
------

I converted my daughter’s crib to a daybed over the weekend, and we have been using it for two nights and two naps without any issues. My son took to the board game Risk in Chicago, so I installed the iPad version and walked him through it. It was a pizza and tacos weekend because it was a long week.

Work
----

Occasionally, a project feels like you signed up for a race, but the distance keeps changing whenever you are within sight of the finish line. A project we have been finishing up keeps growing.

Community Work
--------------

[Djangonaut Space](https://djangonaut.space): All three of our Djangonauts completed their first tasks, and we are moving on to our first big group project.

Side projects
-------------

- **[Django News Newsletter](https://django-news.com):** We shipped issue [\#241](https://django-news.com/issues/241#start).
- [Django News Jobs](https://jobs.django-news.com): This week, we picked up more jobs that weren’t from one source. I need to write a tool to help maintain this, but it’s a manageable load.
- I bought a new domain name for a project this weekend. More on that soon.

Side Quests
-----------

- I dusted off my YouTube-to-Frontmatter tool and added the ability to pull playlists from a given username. I wrote the files out as JSON and used DuckDB to query them, which worked amazingly well.
- I wrote an Amazon product image downloader for a few blog posts. When the product API did not work, I punted and had ChatGPT write a playwright scraper. It was faster and much less frustrating. I need this for several projects.
- I cleaned up my sitemaps research tool.
- I tried out a screenshots-to-code project and ran some 00s-era websites through it that I wish still existed. If someone wants to give me a few years of funding, I think we can make the web not suck again.
