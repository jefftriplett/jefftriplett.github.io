I’m hosting a regular afternoon edition **tomorrow (Friday, May 30)** to wrap up the month of May.

After that, I’ll be away on vacation, so I’m skipping the first **two** Fridays in June and the first Friday in July.

Here’s the plan:

- **Friday, June 6, 2025:** No office hours (vacation)
- **Friday, June 13, 2025:** No office hours (vacation)
- **Friday, June 20, 2025, 2:30 pm – 4:30 pm** ([Time.is link for CT](https://time.is/0230PM_20_June_2025_in_CT))
- **Friday, June 27, 2025, 2:30 pm – 4:30 pm** ([Time.is link for CT](https://time.is/0230PM_27_June_2025_in_CT))
- **Friday, July 4, 2025:** No office hours (US Holiday)

High‑level details
------------------

ℹ️ **Anyone** is welcome to join office hours. Many join because they work remotely, miss seeing faces, and enjoy the spontaneous conversations that occur when a small group gathers.

ℹ️ It’s a collaborative space where we discuss ongoing projects, catch up, and finish the week on a productive note.

🙏 Everyone is welcome, whether you’re a regular or it’s your first time. If you’re curious, reach out.
