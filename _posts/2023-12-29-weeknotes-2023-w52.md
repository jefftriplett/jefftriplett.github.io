## December shipping stats

I broke these out by the month because I needed to take the time to look up weekly stats.

- 🚀 Updated and made a few fixes for the [DjangoCon Archive Project](https://github.com/djangocon/djangocon-archive-project)
- 🚀 Published 11 updates to [Django Packages](https://djangopackages.org)
- 🚀 Published 39 updates to [Django News Jobs](https://jobs.django-news.com) to fix layout, navigation, and other behind-the-scenes issues. I need to add a blog or something to track changes publicly.
