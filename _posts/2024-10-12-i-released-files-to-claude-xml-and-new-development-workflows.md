After months of using and sharing this tool via a private gist, I finally carved out some time to release [files-to-claude-xml](https://github.com/jefftriplett/files-to-claude-xml).

Despite my social media timeline declaring LLMs dead earlier today, I have used [Claude Projects](https://www.anthropic.com/news/projects) and Artifacts.

My workflow is to copy a few files into a Claude Project and then create a new chat thread where Claude will help me write tests or build out a few features.

My `files-to-claude-xml` script grew out of some research I did where I stumbled on their [Essential tips for long context prompts](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/long-context-tips#essential-tips-for-long-context-prompts) which documents how to get around some file upload limits which encourages uploading one big file using Claudeâ€™s XML-like format.

With `files-to-claude-xml`, I build a list of files that I want to import into a Claude Project. Then, I run it to generate a `_claude.xml` file, which I drag into Claude. I create a new conversation thread per feature, then copy the finished artifacts out of Claude once my feature or thread is complete.

After the feature is complete, I delete the `_claude.xml` file from my project and replace it with an updated copy after I re-run `files-to-claude-xml`.

Features on the go
------------------

One bonus of using Claude Projects is that once everything is uploaded, I can use the Claude iOS app as a sort-of notes app and development tool. I can start parallel conversation threads and have it work on new ideas and features. Once I get back to my desktop, I can pull these chat conversations up, and if I like the direction of the feature, I might use them. If not, I have wasted no time or effort on them. This also serves as a nice ToDo list.

New workflows
-------------

I am working on side projects further using this methodology. Sometimes, I would like to work on something casually while watching Netflix, but my brain shuts off from coding during the day. Instead of feeling bad that I havenâ€™t added share links to a website or some feature I meant to add last week, I can pair Claude to work on it with me.

I can also get more done with my lunch hours on projects like [DjangoTV](https://djangotv.com) than I could have otherwise. Overall, Iâ€™m happy to have an on-demand assistant to pair with and work on new features and ideas.

Itâ€™s also quicker to try out new ideas and projects that I would have needed to make time for.

Alternatives
------------

Simon Willison wrote [files-to-prompt](https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt), which I think is also worth trying. I contributed to the discussion, feedback, and document structure for the `--cxml` feature.

I wrote `files-to-claude-xml` before Simon had cxml support and hoped to not release my version.

However, after trying it out on several projects, my ignore/exclude list grew more significant than the files that I wanted to include in my project to send to Claude. I found it easier to generate a list of files to pass to mine instead of maintaining a long list to exclude.
