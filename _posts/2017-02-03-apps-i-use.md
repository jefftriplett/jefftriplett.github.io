These are the apps that I use daily or almost daily which I can't live without. Some are even free :free:.

[1Keyboard][] turns your Mac into a Bluetooth keyboard for your iPhone, iOS, Apple TV, another Mac, and it even works with the FireTV. I hate typing on my iPhone's keyboard and 1Keyboard let's you do this seamlessly. :heavy_dollar_sign:

[1Password][] generates secure passwords and settings and remembers them so I don't have to. The iOS app works great too. :heavy_dollar_sign:

[Airmail][] is my goto email client for macOS and iOS. Airmail is a great unified inbox email client which supports lots of great features like Send Later, third party integrations, and dozens of other features. :heavy_dollar_sign:

[Bartender][] lets you hide and rearrange macOS menu bar apps. This feature should be built into macOS. :heavy_dollar_sign:

[Duet][] is a fantastic tool which turns your iPad into an external display. This app helps me keep my sanity when I work remotely and a big monitor isn't available. :heavy_dollar_sign:

[Hammerspoon][] is an automation tool for macOS. It replaced SizeUp, Divvy, and a few other tools for me which control how my desktop windows are managed. :free:

[Homebrew][] is the package manager to use with macOS. :free:

[iTerm2][] I used iTerm2 over Apple's Terminal app. I spent days, weeks, and years of my life in a terminal and iTerm makes it worthwhile. :free:

[Kiwi for Gmail][] is my other goto email client for macOS. I primarily use Kiwi's search and for tracking client email accounts which I don't want to be mixed with my day-to-day inbox.

[Nativefier][] wraps any web page into a native app. I turn websites that I spend lots of time on into native apps with it. I used to use [Fluid][] for this, but Nativefier is OSS. :free:

[ReadKit][] is my reading app of choice for macOS. ReadKit has great Feedly, NewsBlur, RSS, Pinboard, and Instapaper support. :heavy_dollar_sign:

[Resilio Sync][] formerly BitTorrent Sync. I prefer RS over Dropbox mostly because of the flexibility and speed. :heavy_dollar_sign:

[Slack][] I use for work, community work, and keeping up with friends. It's a joy and one of the most productive tools I have ever used when used properly. :free:(ish)

[Sublime Text][] is my go-to text editor for many years. I could write up an entire article about plugins I use. :heavy_dollar_sign:

[Synergy App][] is a software KVM which lets you use one keyboard and mouse to control another Mac, Linux, or PC. I find this tool to be invaluable despite releases being buggy (please fix your clipboard bugs). :heavy_dollar_sign:

[Todoist][] is my go-to todo list app and the macOS client works well. :free:(ish)

[Tower][] I never thought I needed a git GUI tool until I started using Tower. Now I can't imagine my development life without it. It's not cheap, but it's worth every penny. :heavy_dollar_sign:

[VMD][] is a great tool for live previewing markdown files. :free:
