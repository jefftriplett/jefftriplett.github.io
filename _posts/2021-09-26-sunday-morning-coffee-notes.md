## 🍂 Fall and food edition.

I took the week off to staycation, @pyweek, and work on djangopackages.org. All in all, it was a good week.

## 👾 PyWeek 32

The goal of PyWeek is to build a game from scratch in one week using Python. It's held in March and September every year.

I had a late start and only made it a day and a half before stalling out. It was fun, but I needed a break.

## 🧰 New tool: an Nginx playground

Filed under things that I would never have thought of and useful to learn and experiment with Nginx.

## 🔥 Remove unnecessary files in node_modules

Josh Sherman walks us through deleting all the unused files in the project's node_modules folder, which helps build smaller container images and for fixed-sized environments like AWS Lambda.

## 🐑 Guerilla Grazing and Ingenious Off-Grid Living 🐏

While I have no plans of ever living off the grid, this is fascinating to watch.

## 🗓 Today Is September 21st

This is the sixth and final September 21st video by Demi Adejuyigbe. It's a great way to celebrate the end of summer and the beginning of the next season.

## 🧀 How to Cut & Serve Every Different Kind of Cheese

Yes, how to cut the cheese videos because of jokes. Seriously, though, this should be in a series of "useful things for adults."
