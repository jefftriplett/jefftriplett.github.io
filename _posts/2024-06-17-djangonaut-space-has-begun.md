This is my first time helping out with [Djangonaut Space](https://djangonaut.space) as a Navigator for the [Django Packages](https://djangopackages.org) project.

Last week was week zero, making this week one and the first week my team gets to meet as a group.

Coordinating meeting times is always hard when everyone is from a different timezone, and this was no exception. Thankfully, we found a 30-minute block that works for everyone.

Everyone on my team contributed something positive immediately after the meeting invite, including a few project contributions. All in week zero!

Overall, I’m looking forward to it. I feel under and over-prepared, but I keep getting reassured to take it slow. So, I have some new issues to tag and fill in details before we meet on Wednesday, but we have started, and that’s exciting.
