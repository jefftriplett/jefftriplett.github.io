I wrote most of this in a car on Friday, but I ran out of time to add screenshots and actually hit publish. Oops! Here's a Sunday version of my Friyay series!

This week was all about Emoji and I wanted to share some of my favorite Emoji resources!

## Emoji Cheat Sheet

[Emoji Cheat Sheet](https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/){: target="_blank" } has been my goto Emoji search for several years. The website is great for looking up Emoji short codes on websites like GitHub or Slack, when I can't otherwise find them.

## From English to Emoji

If you have ever wanted to translate from English to Emoji then [emoji-translate](https://meowni.ca/emoji-translate/){: target="_blank" } is for you. The service allows you type in a sentence and then the service does its best to translate the words into Emoji.

## GitHub Emojis API

The [GitHub Emojis API](https://developer.github.com/v3/emojis/){: target="_blank" } is a great place to check for the latest Emoji updates when the other tools haven't been updated in a while. I wish more tools leveraged this GitHub API.

## Emoji Support in Linux

After [building my dashboard](/2017/five-for-friday/){: target="_blank" } a few months ago, I soon noticed that my Emoji posts were not showing up as I expected them to. After some research, I stumbled on the fix via [Make Emoji Work in Linux](https://www.kirsle.net/blog/entry/make-emoji-work-in-linux){: target="_blank" }. The trick is to install the Symbola font and then everything just worked for me.

## Bonus: Emoji Homepage :eyes:

Since I'm both a day late in publishing this article and I missed updating last week, I decided to throw [Emoji Homepage :eyes:](http://emojihomepage.com/){: target="_blank" } in as a bonus. This tool is another spin on the classic Emoji lookups.
