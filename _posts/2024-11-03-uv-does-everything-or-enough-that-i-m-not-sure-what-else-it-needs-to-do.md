UV feels like one of those old infomercials where it solves everything, which is where we have landed in the Python world.

I have had several discussions with friends about UV, and even when we talk about it during my weekly(ish) office hours, the list has grown to an ever-growing number of options.

UV started as a quicker way of installing Python packages, and now itâ€™s easier to tell people that UV does everything and to focus on what it doesnâ€™t do.

My favorite feature is that UV can now bootstrap a project to run on a machine that does not previously have Python installed, along with installing any packages your application might require.

Here is my incomplete list of what UV does today:

- `uv pip install` replaces pip install
- `uv venv` replaces `python -m venv`
- `uv pip compile` replaces pip-tools compile
- `uv pip sync` replaces pip-tools sync
- `uv run` replaces pipx
- `uv tool run` replaces pipx
- `uv python` replaces pyenv, asdf, mise, and several other like-minded tools
- `uv build` - Build your Python package for pypi
- `uv publish` - Upload your Python package to pypi
- `astral-sh/setup-uv` brings UV to GitHub Actions
- `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest` brings UV and Python to Docker

I copied these four from `uv --help`, which feels like poetry features.

- `uv add` - Add dependencies to the project
- `uv remove` - Remove dependencies from the project
- `uv sync` - Update the projectâ€™s environment
- `uv lock` - Update the projectâ€™s lockfile

So what doesnâ€™t UV do?
----------------------

UV does a lot, but it still needs to do everything.

- UV doesnâ€™t convert my non-UV-based projects to UV. Converting is more about prefixing and replacing my commands to switch over.
- UV doesnâ€™t manage, and bump version numbers like the [BumpVer](https://github.com/mbarkhau/bumpver), and others do.
- UV doesnâ€™t manage [pre-commit](https://micro.webology.dev/) like hooks. This is a long shot, but Iâ€™d love to see support via `pyproject.toml`.
- UV doesnâ€™t replace Python, nor should it.
