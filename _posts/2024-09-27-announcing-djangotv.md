Friends, Iâ€™m launching a half-finished website idea that I have been playing around with for a while. [djangotv.com](https://djangotv.com) is focused on promoting and searching Django videos to make discovery easier.

I wanted to launch DjangoTV before I left DjangoCon US 2024, so Iâ€™m technically announcing it from the airport. Last year, I launched [Django News Jobs](https://jobs.django-news.com) during the Django sprints because I was annoyed by the state of the various Django job boards.

After a year of hearing people complain about Django and Python YouTube videos not getting enough views, I decided to address the problem by building out a website to help organize and promote them.

DjangoTV is not competing with pyvideo.org. PyVideo is a fantastic resource for the Python community, and one of my goals is to make it easier to get Django content on PyVideo, too.

DjangoTV is incomplete, and I have many ideas to improve it, including backfilling some of our older conferences, adding presenters, and adding some other metadata to make it a useful community resource.

I focused on DjangoCon videos to bootstrap the project, and weâ€™ll slowly expand our archives. I have been extracting good quotes, adding transcriptions, and adding better summaries. Please expect this to change a lot. I even launched the website with DEBUG turned on for a few days before I turned it off.

Your feedback is crucial to us. If you have any ideas or suggestions, please donâ€™t hesitate to share them.

Most importantly, names change, people change, and bodies change. Itâ€™s essential to me that we respect each other and handle this with care. If you have a concern or need us to pull a video, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out; we will take care of it.
