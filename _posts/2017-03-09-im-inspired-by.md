Yesterday was [International Women's Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women's_Day) (IWD). In honor of IWD, I decided to highlight some of the women who inspire me and mention them on Twitter.

My list is far from comprehensive or complete. I know I'm missing dozens of people who inspire me. If your name is missing, please know that it wasn't intentional. I stopped after forty people came to mind and I barely scratched the surface of anyone who's outside of the Django community.

If you are a conference organizer and you are struggling to find inspiring women to keynote or present at your conference then you are doing your community a disservice. Good intentions be damned.
