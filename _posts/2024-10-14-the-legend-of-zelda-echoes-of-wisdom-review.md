My oldest kiddo and I finished The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom tonight. The 2D Zelda games are some of my favorite games of all time.

I was worried about the game‚Äôs overall look. It looked too much like Link‚Äôs Awakening, which I wasn‚Äôt a fan of compared to the GameBoy version.

I‚Äôm happy to say the screenshots don‚Äôt do the game justice. They perfected their 2D engine and included some camera control, which helps prevent disappearing into the shadows and behind objects.

The game feels like a sequel to 90s SNES A Link to the Past game with some features from the more recent Switch 3D Zeldas and lore. They even built off of the original Zelda‚Äôs 2D dungeon side-scrolling mode in a way that I thought was a lot of fun without dreading it.

While I‚Äôm happy to see Zelda finally get her own game, I thought the character had a lot of depth and one of the most interesting sets of powers and echoes, which allows for a dizzyingly large number of monsters and objects that Zelda can conjure on demand.

My only complaint was that I snagged a Lynel within the first few hours of play, but I only had enough power right before the last battle of the game to conjure it.

I‚Äôm happy that they thought out post-ending gameplay to make finding everything you missed easier, which was refreshing, instead of being stuck in a weird state.

Echoes of Wisdom might be my favorite 2D(ish) Zelda game and one of my favorite Zelda games.

I hope Nintendo lets Grezzo, the game studio behind it, continue to make weird, 2D Zelda games. This game makes me want to explore the studio‚Äôs other Nintendo 3DS Zelda games that I missed out on.
