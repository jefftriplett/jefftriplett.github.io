Blogging is back, so why not bring back Webrings, too?

**[The Great Django Webring](https://djangowebring.com)** is a tribute to the early web. It‚Äôs a cozy loop of community sites and projects, all linked together jor the joy of discovery.

Join the ring. Explore the community. Rediscover the magic of a smaller, friendlier internet.
