Continuing in the tradition of my [2018](https://jefftriplett.com/2018/djangocon-us-talks-i-d-like-to-see-2018-edition/), [2017](https://jefftriplett.com/2017/django-talks-id-like-to-see/), and [2016](https://jefftriplett.com/2016/djangocon-us-talks-id-like-to-see/) "DjangoCon US 2022 Talks I'd like to see" posts, here is an update for 2022. Also, don't miss our official post [Need Suggestions for a DjangoCon US 2022 Topic?](https://2022.djangocon.us/news/topic-suggestions-for-cfp/).

Since it's been several years since I came up with my list, I wanted to revisit some ideas that I would like to watch.
While most of these are heavily Django or Python-focused, historical, some of our best talks complement Django more than are about Django or Python direction. 
We welcome and would love to see several of these too.

## Talks I'd like to see at DjangoCon US 2022

- What's new in Django 4 (4.1 and 4.2)
- What's new in Django Channels 3

- What's new in Wagtail

## Embracing HTML

- An intro to HTMx
- An intro to Alpine JS
