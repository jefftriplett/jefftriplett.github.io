I love Sunday mornings. I love making coffee, wearing my favorite slippers, sitting down at my desk to open ReadKit, and catching up on blogs from the last week. Sometimes I listen to music, a podcast, a YouTube video, or I will just enjoy the silence.

I star my favorites and save many away to my [pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:jefftriplett) account. Most are private, but I try to share a few.

## List of Lists

I love lists, todos, goals, and playlists. Here's a mix of them all.

- [Una Kravets: I'm Useless Without a To-Do List](https://una.im/productivity-2017/#%F0%9F%92%81)

- [Grace Spelman's very specific Spotify playlists ](https://open.spotify.com/user/129623282)
> Like songs with handclaps, horn intros, somebody goes 'uh' and songs for short attention spans (via [@glass](https://pinboard.in/u:glass/))

- [NPR: The 50 Best Albums Of 2017](https://www.npr.org/2017/12/12/568400855/the-50-best-albums-of-2017)

- [MetaFilter: The Best Podcasts of 2017](https://www.metafilter.com/171229/The-Best-Podcasts-of-2017)

- [The Twitch Streaming Gift Guide For 2017](https://www.theweirdlings.com/twtich-streaming-gift-guide-2017/) - I love seeing how other people do their craft and the equipment that they use.

- [Josh Sherman: My 2018 Goals](https://joshtronic.com/2017/11/27/my-2018-goals/)

## Advice And A Better Life

- [Adam Smith: Road Lyfe](http://roadlyfe.com/quiet/) Adam gets it. He travels, takes every photo, and writes every word. Follow his blog. 

- [Swissmiss: 7 Things Every Kids Needs To Hear](http://www.swiss-miss.com/2017/12/7-things-every-kids-needs-to-hear.html)
 
> 1. I love you
> 2. I’m proud of you
> 3. I’m sorry
> 4. I forgive you
> 5. I’m listening
> 6. This is your responsibility
> 7. You’ve got what it takes
> 
> – Josh Shipp

- [Seth Godin: Slow and steady](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2017/12/slow-and-steady.html)

> The hard part is "steady."

> Anyone can go slow. It takes a special kind of commitment to do it steadily, drip after drip until you get to where you're going.

- [Seth Godin: Modern laziness](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2017/12/modern-laziness.html)

> Modern lazy avoids emotional labor. This is the laziness of not raising your hand to ask the key question, not caring about those in need or not digging in to ship something that might not work. Lazy is arguing instead of a thoughtful conversation. Lazy is waiting until the last minute. And lazy is avoiding what we fear.

## The Holidays and Holiday Blues

- [Chris Guillebeau: Feeling Sad On The Holidays? Me Too. Here’s All I Know How To Do](https://chrisguillebeau.com/feeling-sad-on-the-holidays/)

- [Cait Flanders: 60+ Minimalist Holiday Traditions](https://caitflanders.com/2017/12/13/minimalist-holiday-traditions/) I especially liked the "Traditions You Can Do with Your Kids" and "Traditions You Can Do for Others" sections. 

## Home Lab

- [Jessie Frazelle: Personal Infrastructure](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/personal-infrastructure/) - It's true, I spent most of my Saturday evening compiling Jessie's Dockerfiles and setting up my own Jenkins server on my Intel Skull NUC.

  I'm happy that Jessie shares her home and laptop setup with us. I feel like I'm just trying to keep up for as long as I can.

## Recipes To Try

- [KetoGasm: Broccoli & Goat Cheese Soup Recipe](https://ketogasm.com/broccoli-goat-cheese-soup-recipe/) - I love Broccoli soup so of course, I'm going to try this one.

## Products

- [Tools & Toys: Yaktrax Pro Strap-On Ice & Snow Traction Cleats](http://toolsandtoys.net/yaktrax-pro-strap-on-ice-snow-traction-cleats/) - I picked up my first pair of Yaktrax over seven years ago. I spent the better part of that time living downtown and commuting to work by foot. We get a lot of ice in Kansas which makes walking on sidewalks dangerous until I found Yaktrax. I keep a spare pair in my backpack during the cold months. I don't own one pair; I own four pairs which I purchased when they were on sale in spring.
