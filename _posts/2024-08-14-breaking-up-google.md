Here are my thoughts on John Gruberâ€™s recent article and notes on the [Google Monopoly](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/14/us-google-breakup).

> I mean, letâ€™s say Google was forced to spin Chrome off. How would Chrome Inc. make money? Clearly, theyâ€™d make money through TAC fee payments from Google search. &gt;Also, if they split off Chrome theyâ€™d almost have to split off Android.

Chrome Inc will be quite profitable, making $20 billion a year from Alphabet to set Google Search as the default search engine on Chrome. The same model works for Android Inc, too.

The Justice Department doesnâ€™t exist to figure out Alphabetâ€™s business model nor does it care to. The fact that everything is so tied together that itâ€™s hard to split up doesnâ€™t is only further proof that Google is a monopoly.

> If Google is disallowed from making its own web browser how in the world can they make an OS? I mean in theory they could make an OS that only offered third-party browsers but that would mean no system-level webview for apps to embed. Some people laughed at Microsoftâ€™s late-1990s argument that Windows needed a built-in browser but thatâ€™s obviously true today. Itâ€™s no different than including a TCP/IP networking stack or printer drivers.

The OS which is Linux based can go with Chrome. Google doesnâ€™t need their own OS to work on Mac, iOS, Windows, and other operating system they run their products on.

> I donâ€™t know what the remedy ought to be for this case, but I donâ€™t think a breakup is it.

A breakup is better for consumers. Googleâ€™s stranglehold on the online ad industry will feel painful after itâ€™s broken up. The only reason it feels hard to break Google into so many new companies is because itâ€™s such a one-sided monopoly. However, that doesnâ€™t justify not breaking them up.

Google has a long history of pushing technology that is only good for Google. Does anyone remember [AMP](https://www.theverge.com/23711172/google-amp-accelerated-mobile-pages-search-publishers-lawsuit) and how Google forced the publishing industry to jump to a platform that only benefited them?

It makes sense to chop Alphabet + Google into dozens of smaller companies. Chrome, Android, Gmail, Docs (maybe Maps), and hardware should stand independently. Search and Ads should each be divided into multiple companies. The goal isnâ€™t to make business sense; it is to divide the company into parts that compete against themselves.
