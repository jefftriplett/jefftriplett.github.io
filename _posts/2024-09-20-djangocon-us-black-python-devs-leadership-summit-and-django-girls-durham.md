Iâ€™m heading to Durham, NC, for seven days of [DjangoCon US](https://2024.djangocon.us) this Friday. This is my 10th year volunteering and the 9th year that [DEFNA](https://www.defna.org), the non-profit I co-founded, has run a DjangoCon US event. Here is an overview of the week.

Black Python Devs Leadership Summit (Saturday)
----------------------------------------------

Iâ€™m attending and speaking on a discussion panel on Saturday at the [Black Python Devs Leadership Summit](https://blackpythondevs.com/leadership-summit-2024/). Tickets are free, and they will be streaming online in the afternoon. Donations are accepted and appreciated.

Django Girls Durham (Saturday)
------------------------------

[Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/en/durham/) are hosting a Django workshop and teaching beginners a crash course on building their first website using Django.

DjangoCon US Tutorials (Sunday)
-------------------------------

On Sunday morning, Iâ€™ll be volunteering and helping out at the tutorials. In the afternoon, we have a tradition of stuffing swag bags, which takes a big group and is a fun way to kick off the conference. You do not need a tutorial ticket or an organizer to help out. Ask at the registration desk, and they can direct you to when and where we are doing this.

Django Social meetup (Sunday)
-----------------------------

My company [REVSYS](https://www.revsys.com) is sponsoring a [DjangoSocial Raleigh/Durham Pre-DjangoCon Special](https://www.meetup.com/djangosocial-raleighdurham/events/303526332//attendees/) meetup on Sunday evening before the conference kicks off. The meetup will be great for meeting other attendees the night before the conference.

DjangoCon US Talks (Monday through Wednesday)
---------------------------------------------

The talks are great, but the busiest three days of the conference are also the busiest. There is always a lot going on, from sun up to sun down.

DjangoCon US Sprints (Thursday and Friday)
------------------------------------------

The sprints are one of my favorite parts of the conference. In past years, I have been so exhausted by the sprints that itâ€™s hard to sit down and focus. Itâ€™s one of the best times to discuss Django and the Django ecosystem. If you have a project or want to find a project to help with, the sprints are great for getting your feet wet.

Outro
-----

Tickets are still available if you live near Durham and want to attend. Both events have online and in-person options, so there is no pressure to make last-minute travel plans.

If you live around Durham and want to meet up, please reach out. Letâ€™s see if we can meet for coffee.
