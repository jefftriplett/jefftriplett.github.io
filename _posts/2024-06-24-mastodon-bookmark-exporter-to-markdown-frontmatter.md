I wrote a Mastodon Bookmark exporter tool over the weekend and decided to polish it up and release it tonight.

I wrote the tool to help me sort out Mastodon posts that I might bookmark to follow up on or write about. I bookmark posts on the go or even from bed, and when I have time, I will pull them back up.

The Mastodon Bookmark exporter tool reads your Mastodon bookmarks and exports the latest posts to a markdown/frontmatter file.

Iâ€™m releasing the project as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/jefftriplett/623039d2fd09b959eadde6a496ade47a) under the [PolyForm Noncommercial License](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0%3E) for personal reasons. If you have licensing questions, contact me directly or through [www.revsys.com](https://www.revsys.com) for commercial inquiries, and we can work something out.
