I’m about 30 or 40 years too young for [A Man on the Inside](https://trakt.tv/shows/a-man-on-the-inside), but I enjoyed it.

Ted Danson plays “a retired professor gets a new lease on life when a private investigator hires him to go undercover inside a San Francisco retirement home.”

It’s hard to watch a few of the episodes with a dry eye, but it’s worth the journey, and it’s a series I finished in just a few nights.
