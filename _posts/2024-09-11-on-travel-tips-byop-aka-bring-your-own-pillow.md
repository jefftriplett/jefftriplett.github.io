ðŸŽ’ While some of my friends and colleagues can pack everything they need in a small backpack for a weekâ€™s travel, I am not that person.

I turned into the person who brings their pillow when they travel, and it changed my stay and quality of sleep by 1000%.

There are many variables you canâ€™t control when you travel, but the pillow is the one variable I can control, and it has the biggest impact on my overall sleep quality. Itâ€™s frustrating to pay $200 or more a night for a nice hotel room and then to have a lousy night of sleep because of a flat pillow.

You canâ€™t control the mattress quality you sleep on, but having a decent pillow takes the edge off for me.

Itâ€™s also an excellent excuse to buy a new pillow for your home in case your bag gets damaged, something happens to your pillow, and you need to throw your old pillow away. That also eases the burden so you can throw your travel pillow in the wash as soon as you get back without disrupting your first night back home.

In conclusion, you can bring your own pillow if you struggle with sleep while traveling. Itâ€™s a relatively cheap life hack that might require a slightly bigger bag, but it might be worth it for improved sleep quality.
