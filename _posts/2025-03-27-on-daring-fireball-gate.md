This post caught my eye this afternoon: [mastodon.social/@daringfi…](https://mastodon.social/@daringfireball/114235193603919597)

I have read both for over 20 years, but I’m always surprised when I see one of Jon’s articles on HN. They have always felt like different crowds to me. HN has always felt more about what’s new with startups and tech, whereas Jon’s articles range from excellent Apple insights to being an extension of Apple’s PR department, which is fine. Jon has always been an Apple fan, but at some point, this take felt more fanboi than fanboy.

I suspect most of HN are big tech workers in a tech hub, startup bros/bras, and, on average, aren’t daily Apple product users compared to what is mainstream.

I don’t think Jon’s writing has slipped, but he’s pitching against a home team, which never sits well with the locals. ⚾
