## What I'm tweeting

This week to celebrate International Women's Day (IWD), I created a [Twitter Moment](https://twitter.com/i/moments/839613911754244097) dedicated to the many women who inspire me. I also compiled it into a blog post [I'm Inspired By](https://jefftriplett.com/2017/im-inspired-by/).

## Quote I'm pondering

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">everyday that goes by, this is getting more accurate ðŸ˜¬<br>from: <a href="https://t.co/c4atTBXjDr">https://t.co/c4atTBXjDr</a>  cc <a href="https://twitter.com/lrnrd">@lrnrd</a> <a href="https://t.co/HmkFc4xIQh">pic.twitter.com/HmkFc4xIQh</a></p>&mdash; Ana Rosas (@ana_rosas) <a href="https://twitter.com/ana_rosas/status/840065046612860928">March 10, 2017</a></blockquote>

I can 100% relate to Ana's tweet both as a conference organizer and for public speaking.

## What I'm trying

Between multiple clients and community commitments, I have been struggling to fit everything in without overworking. I stumbled on this [Start With a Full Calendar](https://medium.com/time-dorks/start-with-a-full-calendar-8da582cc4890#.ng0dg2j4f) article and it has really resonated with me. I have already started blocking out time chunks during the week to give me time to keep up with everything. 

I use [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) to automate scheduling meetings so this system blends perfectly with the service. 

## What I'm reading

I really enjoyed this [In Conversation: David Letterman](http://www.vulture.com/2017/03/david-letterman-in-conversation.html) interview. I'm glad that Dave still does interviews and is vocal about what he believes in.

## What I'm watching

The David Letterman ["I Like Kettlecorn"](http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/david-letterman-i-like-kettlecorn) episode of Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee by Jerry Seinfeld is worth a watch. I enjoy David Letterman's sense of humor outside of his show more and more.
