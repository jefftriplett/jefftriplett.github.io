I do not want Discord’s Nitro.  
I do not want it, friend or foe.

I will not boost, I will not pay,  
I do not want it any day.

I do not want it on my phone,  
I do not want it when I’m alone.

I do not want it for more emoji,  
I do not want it—it feels too showy.

I will not take it on a stream,  
I will not buy it for a meme.

I do not want it, Sam-I-Post.  
Discord Nitro? Not even close.
