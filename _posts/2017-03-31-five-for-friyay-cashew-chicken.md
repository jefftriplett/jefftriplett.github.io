## What I'm reading

One of my favorite things about being back home in SWMO, is getting to eat Springfield Style Cashew Chicken. There's nothing quite like it and I rarely see it outside of SWMO. When I do see Cashew Chicken on a menu, it hardly resembles the classic version I grew up with and loved. 

This is David Leong's story who created Springfield Style Cashew Chicken more than 50 years ago: [Missouri Chinese: Two Cultures Claim This Chicken](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/dining/11cashew.html).

## Service I'm using

[Supermute](https://supermute.feeltrain.com/) has made Twitter bearable again. The service allows you to mute words for a period of time and it also shows you which accounts are impacted by it. At one point, mine was blocking 254 users and I could happily use Twitter browse Twitter again.
