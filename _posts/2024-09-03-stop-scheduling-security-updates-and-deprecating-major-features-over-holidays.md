I know people outside the US ðŸ™„ at this, but please stop releasing major security updates and backward incompatible changes over major US, international, and religious holidays.

Given that major security updates are embargoed and scheduled weeks and months in advance, itâ€™s essential to coordinate and avoid conflicts. A simple check of the calendar before scheduling announcements can prevent such issues.

Even if you give everyone two weeks' notice, aka what GitHub just did, wait to schedule them for release over a holiday weekend.

Historically, the Python and Django communities have also been guilty of this, so Iâ€™m not just finger-pointing at GitHub. We can all do better here.
