Some of my favorite projects are what we would consider really “bad” code, but their apps either work or sort of work.

There are no feature branches—only a main branch.

They don’t open pull requests or spend time on the dozens or hundreds of open pull requests.

The commit message stream is nothing but “updates” or “fixed” commit subjects.

They leave you feeling that each commitment will be the last before they never touch the project again.

They aren’t playing by any rules because they are only focused on the problem they are working on.

They owe us nothing, and yet they are sharing their work.

The project is only complete after they have scratched the itch and moved on to another project.
