I dove into [Echofeed](https://echofeed.app) this weekend, and I set up three new Echos that consume RSS feeds of various services.

Every time I publish a new blog post on my [micro.blog](https://micro.webology.dev), a new blog post gets published on my [main website](https://jefftriplett.com). My website is currently hosted on GitHub Pages via Jekyll, and Echofeed does the heavy lifting to create a new frontmatter + markdown file for every post.

I also added two more Echos, which consume my [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/users/jefftriplett) RSS feeds to track every movie and series I watch into their collections.

I plan to list both data points on my [now](https://jefftriplett.com/now/) page, which I always intended to capture what I’m currently consuming and doing.

I also use Echofeed to publish these microblog posts to my [Mastodon account](https://mastodon.social/@webology). I prefer this over micro.blog’s built-in cross-posting features because Echofeed lets me create a custom post template, which is more flexible. I’m using the same workflow for [Django News and Django Packages](https://micro.webology.dev/2024/05/31/on-echofeed.html).

Overall, I’m impressed with Echofeed, and I’m happy to pay $25 a year for the value I’m getting from it. Please let me know what you think if you try it out and find some value in it.
