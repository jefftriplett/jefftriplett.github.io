I need to re-read/re-listen to Carlton‚Äôs [Evolving Django‚Äôs `auth.User`](https://buttondown.com/carlton/archive/evolving-djangos-authuser/) Stack Report before I have a firm opinion, but I saw his [Mastodon post](https://mastodon.social/@carlton@fosstodon.org/113113728832109272) and I thought it was worth sharing some initial thoughts.

On my first read, I fell into the camp that wants `django-unique-user-email` and full name to be the defaults on Django‚Äôs built-in User. I have wanted this forever, and my clients do, too.

Django should still allow me to create a custom user, but the documentation could be better. Django‚Äôs documentation is a topic for another day, but I‚Äôm confused by it and find it less and less helpful. I notice the developers I work with get lost in them, too. Docs may be a good DjangoCon US topic if you want to discuss it in a few weeks.

I would love the default User to have a unique email address, full name, and a short name. Optionally, a username is an email address setting. Please don‚Äôt take away the ability to have a custom User model.

Carlton‚Äôs ‚ÄúAction points‚Äù conclusion seems reasonable to me.
