Join Us
-------

These sessions are open to anyone, especially those working remotely who wants to connect with others. It’s a collaborative space for discussions, catch-ups, or just hanging out while you work.

While we have a bunch of Python and Django developers who regularly attend, anyone is welcome to join even if you don’t use either of these things.

Whether you’re a first-time attendee or a regular, you’re welcome to drop in anytime during the session. No need to stay for the full two hours, come and go as your schedule allows.

How to Join
-----------

The Zoom link is available in the gist from our previous sessions. Feel free to reach out if you need the details.
