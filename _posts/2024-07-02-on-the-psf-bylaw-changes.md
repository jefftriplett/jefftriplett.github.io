The Python Software Foundation has three bylaw changes up for a vote in this yearâ€™s election. I support all there.

Here is their post, [For your consideration: Proposed bylaws changes to improve our membership experience](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/06/for-your-consideration-proposed-bylaws.html) and a follow-up post [FAQ for Proposed Changes to PSF Bylaws](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/06/faq-for-proposed-changes-to-psf-bylaws.html) that addresses questions that came up.

Change 1: Merging Contributing and Managing member classes
----------------------------------------------------------

The existing two classes need to be clarified and updated. We want contributors, and code is only one of many ways to contribute to a healthy community.

âœ… Iâ€™m all for this. I support this change.

Change 2: Simplifying the voter affirmation process by treating past voting activity as intent to continue voting
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before the voting affirmation process was enforced, meeting the 30% quorum mark was an issue.

Last year, over 70% of our members voted, and I suspect we can land somewhere in the middle, letting people continue to vote if they did the previous year and still staying above 50% of our active membership voting.

âœ… I support this change.

Change 3: Allow for removal of Fellows by a Board vote in response to Code of Conduct violations, removing the need for a vote of the membership
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No one in the Python community is above Pythonâ€™s Code of Conduct.

While I disagree that the board cannot already remove a Fellow, itâ€™s better to bring it to the community for a vote.

âœ… As a Python Fellow, past board member, and Code of Conduct WG member, I support this change.
