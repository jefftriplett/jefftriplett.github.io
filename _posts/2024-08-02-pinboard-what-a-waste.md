Earlier this year, I wrote about why I [dumped Pinboard](https://micro.webology.dev/2024/04/11/on-leaving-pinboard.html) after a decade of usage.

This aged well.

I suspect that someday, I will roll out my own commercial Delicious clone for people who just want a reliable bookmark-archiving web service.

A few years ago, I might have said this would be a Pinboard clone, but at least Yahoo knew when to pack it up and shut it down vs. whatever the Pinboard founder has been doing. ðŸ¤·
