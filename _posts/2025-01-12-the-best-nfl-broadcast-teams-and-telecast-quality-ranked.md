[John Gruber](https://mastodon.social/@gruber/113779696867783170) posted his picks a few weeks ago, and I couldn‚Äôt disagree more.

2024 NFL broadcast teams and telecast quality, ranked:

1. Mike Tirico and Chris Collinsworth, NBC (the best duo by a lot)
2. Al Michaels and Kirk Herbstreit, Amazon
3. Jim Nantz and Tony Romo, CBS

‚Äì the floor ‚Äì

4. Kevin Burkhardt and Tom Brady, Fox
5. The Manning Cast. If not for a paint-dryingly bad combo of Joe Buck and Troy Aikman, I would never have put the Manning Cast above anyone. This isn‚Äôt even fair to Aikman, who isn‚Äôt that bad, but Joe Buck should stick with baseball.
6. Joe Buck and Troy Aikman, ABC, aka paint drying

Al Michaels, Mike Tirico, and Chris Collinsworth are what football sounds like to me after Madden. Damn, I miss Madden. Even boringly one-sided games he made special.
