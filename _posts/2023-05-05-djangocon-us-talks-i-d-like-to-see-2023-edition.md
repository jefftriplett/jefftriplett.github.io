Continuing in the tradition of my [2022][], [2018][], [2017][], and [2016][] "DjangoCon US Talks I'd like to see" posts, here is an update for 2023.

Also, don't miss our official post [Need Suggestions for a DjangoCon US 2023 Topic?](https://2023.djangocon.us/news/topic-suggestions-for-cfp/).

## Talks I'd like to see at DjangoCon US 2023

- What's new in Django 4.2?
- What's new in Django 5.x?
- What's new in Django Channels?
- What's new in Python 3.11 and 3.12 for Django developers? 
- What's new in Wagtail?

## Embracing HTML and lightweight front-end frameworks

2023 is shaping up to be the year of "you probably don't need JavaScript," and hello, getting more done in less time. 

Lightweight front-end frameworks like HTMx, Alpine JS, and Tailwind CSS allow more things to be done in HTML without requiring full-fledged JavaScript stacks, frameworks, or libraries. These frameworks focus on enhancing HTML and CSS capabilities and promoting simplicity, maintainability, and improved performance while offering powerful tools for building user interfaces.

With this in mind, I'd love to do a few talks based on these topics:

- HTMx and intermediate content
- Tailwind CSS and intermediate content
- Alpine JS and intermediate content

## Django best practices

- Async Django
- Django Testing (pytest) best practices, aka "stop fearing fixtures."
- Django Feature Flipping
- Django Packaging
- Django Static Assets and Media
- Pull Request and code review
- Reusable Django app
- Working with teams
- Writing Documentation

## Building

These are primarily random topics I haven't seen covered or covered in enough detail yet: 

- Playwright (testing or building apps with it)
- Pandas
- PyScript (how does Django work with?)
- Django Unicorn
- Django Ninja
- Building better management commands with Django-click
- Leveraging Django Checks (why does everything have a check now?)
- Marketing your Django App
- Monetizing your Django App

## Panels

- Django Fellows - could be current and past 
- Django/Python authors - now that we have several community members on their 2nd, 3rd, or 4th book, this could be fun.
- Django apps and community - It would be nice to hear from the more significant apps and community projects 
- DSF board - to see what's new and where they would like to guide the community
