I wasn‚Äôt planning on hosting office hours this week, but given the events of the week, it feels like a damn good way to end the week.

This Friday, November 8th, 2024 from [2:30 pm to 4:30(ish) pm](https://time.is/0230PM_08_November_2024_in_CT?Jeff%27s_Office_Hours), I am hosting office hours.

The rest of November‚Äôs schedule is uncertain, but we‚Äôll figure it out sooner rather than later.

High-level details
------------------

‚ÑπÔ∏è Anyone can join office hours. Many join because they work remotely, miss seeing faces, and miss the random conversations when a small group hangs out.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Our office hours are a collaborative space where we can discuss our ongoing projects, catch up, and work together to wrap up our week on a productive note.

üôè As always, everyone is welcome to join, whether you‚Äôre a regular attendee or joining for the first time. If you are curious, reach out.

‚úÖ If you need any additional details, feel free to send me a message or check out the gist from our previous sessions, where you‚Äôll always find the most recent Zoom link ‚ö†Ô∏è
