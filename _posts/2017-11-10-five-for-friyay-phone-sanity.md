I recently upgraded from a cracked screen iPhone 6 to an iPhone 8 Plus and while I love this phone, I have had buyer's regret ever since. In hindsight, going from a large screen phone to an even larger screen phone was not what I wanted or should have done. Instead, I should have gone with much cheaper, updated iPhone SE and saved money. 

If you aren't happy with your phone or if you are feeling tied down to it, I thought I'd dedicate a Five for Friyay to mobile phone and privacy tips which have made my phone usage better.

## Turn Off Your Phone Notifications

A few years ago, after feeling stressed out every time I picked up my phone, and it was full of notifications, I removed the Facebook app, disabled automatic email checking, turned off most of my notifications, and removed background/location access from all but a few applications. My phone's battery life nearly doubled, and my stress level decreased considerably.

When I saw [Stephanie Hurlburt](https://twitter.com/sehurlburt)'s notification tip, it reminded me that it was time for me to update mine again.

## Change Your Phone To Grayscale

If you are feeling addicted to your phone, then changing your screen to Grayscale might help make your phone less appealing. Check out, [Change Your Screen to Grayscale to Combat Phone Addiction](https://lifehacker.com/change-your-screen-to-grayscale-to-combat-phone-addicti-1795821843)

I switched my phone over earlier this week, and within a day, and I liked it so much, I installed the [Grayscale Black & White - High Contrast](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grayscale-black-white-hig/cjimlckjgclgboeebpjlipmokolejppk) Chrome extension to use when I'm feeling distracted by my browser. I find this to be soothing. 

## Always Use a VPN

If you travel or work out of a shared location, then you should invest in a VPN. I encourage everyone to use a VPN by default to avoid accidentally sending a plain text password down the wire. 

I have used [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/) since 2013, and I have zero complaints. It just works for me, and it's easy to toggle off and on. 

IPA's service works well and is easy to install and update. They have a dedicated iOS application which automatically configures your VPN settings which is more accessible than manually keying in this information.

Still not sure if you need a VPN? Check out [Do you need a VPN?](https://blog.mozilla.org/internetcitizen/2017/08/29/do-you-need-a-vpn/).

## More Tips

Ask MetaFilter's [Tips for divorcing my phone?](http://ask.metafilter.com/303818/Tips-for-divorcing-my-phone) is full of great ideas for using your phone less. 

## Re-evaluate Your Phone Carrier and Stop Overpaying

I switched from AT&T's "Unlimited" data plan which came with my first iPhone to [Cricket Wiress](https://www.cricketwireless.com/) which is a pre-paid phone service and it saved me $900 in the first year alone. The real kicker here is that AT&T owns Cricket Wireless, so my phone is still on the same network. Switching phone carriers decreased my bill from ~$110 a month to $35 and not a penny more.

My plan includes 5G of data each month, and there are no penalties for going over. If you exceed 5G of bandwidth, they de-prioritize your account for the remainder of the month. This works so well that I have never noticed an impact on my phone. 

It's worth pointing out that de-prioritizing isn't the same as throttling. Throttling limits your maximum download speed artificially even if the network isn't in use. De-prioritizing still lets you download at full speed but gives others first dibs. In my testing, this all happens so quickly, that I can't even notice a difference - as it should be.

## Bonus: Grammarly Mobile Keyboard

[Grammarly Mobile Keyboard](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/grammarly-mobile-keyboard/) for iOS helps make your writing clear, effective, and mistake-free. The app was released last week, and it has already saved me from dozens of errors which I would not have caught otherwise. I use it and find it to be helpful.
