For the millionth time, I upgraded macOS to the next major version (Monterey) and I had to search for how to re-enable password-less sudo'ing (don't judge me.)


1. edit `/etc/sudoers`

```shell
sudo visudo
```

2. Then find the admin group permission section:

```shell
%admin          ALL = (ALL) ALL
```

3. Change to add `NOPASSWD:`

```shell
%admin          ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

4. Profit until next year.
