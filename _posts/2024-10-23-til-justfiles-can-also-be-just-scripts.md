TIL that Justfiles can turn into Just Scripts by adding `#!/usr/bin/env just --justfile` to the top of the file and running `chmod +x` on the file.

From the docs:

> By adding a shebang line to the top of a `justfile` and making it executable, `just` can be used as an interpreter for scripts: <https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#just-scripts>

`just.sh`
---------

<div class="highlight">```shell
<span style="color:#75715e">#!/usr/bin/env just --justfile
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>
@_default:
	just --justfile just.sh --list

@lint *ARGS:
    uv --quiet run --with pre-commit-uv pre-commit run <span style="color:#f92672">{{</span> ARGS <span style="color:#f92672">}}</span> --all-files

```

</div>After you run `chmod +x just.sh`, this file may be run using `./just.sh`, and sub-commands everything `just <subcommand>` will just work.

Please note that `--justfile just.sh` is needed if you want your Just Script to be able to introspect or call itself.

Why?

More and more of my clients are using Justfiles, and occasionally, I want some other recipes that may belong outside the default workflows. These can also be reusable between projects for some of my other internal tooling, so itâ€™s an excellent resource to learn about.
