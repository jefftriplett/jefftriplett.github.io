As a parent, the few times an iPad freezes are rare but always seem to happen at the worst possible time and place.

Thankfully, Apple has a hard-to-find page called [If your iPad wonâ€™t turn on or is frozen](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102642) that is surprisingly hard to find in an emergency. This page also breaks down how to restart each model of iPad, which is great for us because we have multiple generations of tablets.
