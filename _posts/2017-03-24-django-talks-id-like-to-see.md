A common question I get asked every year is "What topic should I submit to DjangoCon US?" So many people are unsure of what to talk about.

Since our [DjangoCon US CFP deadline](https://www.papercall.io/djangocon-us-2017) is a little over two weeks away, I thought I'd build an overwhelmingly long list of topic ideas to help anyone who's struggling to come up with a talk idea.

## Essential Skills

I hate the term "soft skills" so I'm calling these "essential skills." Every year some of our best presentations come from this category.

- 12 Factor App
- Accessibility
- Community Development
- Documentation
- Hiring and Interviewing
- Kickstarter Howto
- Leadership
- Marketing
- Problem-Solving
- Project Management
- Public Speaking
- Raise Negotiation
- Self Care
- Time Management

If your topic falls into "not Django," but is not listed here, submit it anyway!

## Frontend

My frontend topics are far from comprehensive because I don't dabble as much here. If I'm missing something obvious or if there is something new and cool, let me know!

- CSS

- Design
    - Material Design - I don't think anyone has covered material design previously.

- Native Apps (iOS / Android) - I have no idea if this can be covered in a 45-minute talk, but I'd love to see someone attempt it.

- Javascript
    - Flux, Reflux, etc
    - React.js - Are there best practices for covering a large app?
    - Vue.js

- Typography

- VR / AR - Last year we had a great talk on how to get started with VR and Django. I'd love to see someone dig a little deeper to build an app.
