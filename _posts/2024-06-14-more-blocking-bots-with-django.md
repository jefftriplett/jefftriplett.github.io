Tonight, I ran across [Robb Knight‚Äôs](https://rknight.me/) [Blocking Bots with Nginx](https://rknight.me/blog/blocking-bots-with-nginx/), which fits well with two pieces I have already written about.

Check out my [ü§ñ Super Bot Fight ü•ä](https://micro.webology.dev/2024/04/18/super-bot-fight.html) article, which develops a Django-friendly middleware for blocking AI UserAgents so they never get to your content.

My [ü§ñ On Robots.txt](https://micro.webology.dev/2024/03/20/on-robotstxt.html) article shared more of my research on the robots.txt standard.

I forgot I wrote the middleware, so I rewrote it tonight before rediscovering it while looking for both articles to share. That was fun, so I‚Äôm not writing more tonight. üò¨
