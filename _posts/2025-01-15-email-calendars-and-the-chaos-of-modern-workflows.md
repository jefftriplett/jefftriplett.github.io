I was feeling overloaded with emails this week, and then I remembered that my out-of-office auto-responder told people they should contact me after the first of the year if they needed me to reply.

Thankfully, I could select and archive all of my 2024 emails with this rule `label:inbox after:2023/12/31 before:2025/01/01`, which reconciled my old emails.

Calendars and shared Documents
------------------------------

With each Google organization, Iâ€™m a member with another Google Calendar, Google Drive, and Google Contacts to manage. That document someone wants feedback on sometimes feels like spinning a wheel, and I need to guess which inbox and account the message might land in.

The best solution that I have found for juggling meeting invites is [Reclaim](https://reclaim.ai), which is terrific for merging multiple calendars into one calendar so I can at least keep on top of meeting invites and scheduling. Dropbox recently bought them, but Iâ€™m hoping that Dropbox will leave them alone.

Email and calendars have become more challenging since I switched to a Mac Studio at the office. While we were returning to work during a blizzard last week, I realized that my personal Mac Mini in my home office had no concept of my work calendar or the 4 or 7 Vivaldi profiles with syncing that I use to jump between orgs all day.

With 1Password, this is a straightforward process to set up and authorize, but it still takes time.

Tonight, Iâ€™m pretty sure I even locked myself out of one service because itâ€™s probably not a typical usage pattern to jump between three Macs over two locations with a half dozen profiles to juggle.

Calendar Agent
--------------

Over the Thanksgiving break, I wrote my first Calendar Agent, who can read and write to my work calendar. Itâ€™s not fully baked yet, but it works well enough to tell me about my upcoming meetings and to create a meeting for me. Sometimes.

The biggest downside to using my Calendar Agent is that I have to run it from my terminal, which isnâ€™t always the most convenient place.

Side note: I might rewrite my agent using [PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev) as an excuse to learn about the Python agent framework, streamline tool-calling, and play with more local agents using [Ollama](https://ollama.com).

The better email solution
-------------------------

The better email solution was a Django email app called Concorde, one of [Adam Fast](https://github.com/adamfast)â€™s creations. It was Django querysets for managing email rules, which I modified and ran over the years. It quickly created better rules than Gmail supported, like deleting old messages in specific folders after x-days. When I kept my fork running and updated, the tool was invaluable. When I kept my Concorde up and running, my email life was healthier than when I was slower to fix it after an upgrade.

Conclusion
----------

Iâ€™m annoyed that the best solutions for these problems are to either pay a company to make a Google Suite usable or you must be a developer to build tools to manage it all.

This stuff sucks.
