As part of my recent [Echofeed discovery](https://micro.webology.dev/2024/06/09/enhancing-my-digital.html), I updated my [now](https://jefftriplett.com/now/) page to list the most recent video games I‚Äôm playing and movies and series I‚Äôm watching. These are all data streams that [Echofeed](https://echofeed.app) collects and publishes for me.

Now that I have this data, it inspired me to create stand-alone pages for my [games](https://jefftriplett.com/games/), [movies](https://jefftriplett.com/movies/), and [series](https://jefftriplett.com/series/) pages, which I will slowly backfill over time.

This process is 90% automated and 10% of the time, I copy cover images from various sources. When I switch from RSS feeds to a few API calls, I can fully automate this process, but for now, this is fine.

I also created a [slashes](https://jefftriplett.com/slashes/) page, which was inspired by the [slash pages](https://slashpages.net) project. This page lists all of my existing slash pages and some I plan to make as my website grows. As I build the page, I will start linking back to them.

One example of a slash page is my [defaults](https://jefftriplett.com/defaults/) page, which started as one of my first [micro.blog posts](https://jefftriplett.com/2023/default-apps-2023/). As my defaults change over time, I plan to update this new defaults page, and if enough changes, I‚Äôll publish my notes and updates via a new micro.blog post.

Overall, I like both of these workflows for my media consumption and my slashes pages. It feels maintainable and gives me an excuse to write more.
