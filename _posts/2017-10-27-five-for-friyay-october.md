## A Project I'm Working On

A few weeks back, I stumbled on [Putting TV Clutter Out of Sight](https://thomaspark.co/2017/10/putting-tv-clutter-out-of-sight/) and this easy to build cord clutter cleanup technique. Last weekend, I dropped by one of our local hardware stores to pick up a sheet of pegboard along with some bolts to build my own. I was tempted to purchase a table saw, but I decided to be more frugal and cut the board at a friend’s house instead. I'll post photos once I'm finished.

## Article / Quote I'm Pondering... and Taking My Time On

[Mike Monteiro: “If you’re waiting for someone else to do the right thing, you’re doing it wrong.”](https://medium.com/aigadc/mike-monteiro-if-youre-waiting-for-someone-else-to-do-the-right-thing-you-re-doing-it-wrong-8ab2b94d98cf)

## New Podcast I'm Listening To

I am enjoying [LaToya Allen's](https://twitter.com/LAbuildsAnApp) [SheNomads](https://shenomads.com/category/podcast/) podcast. The [SheNomads blog](https://shenomads.com/) is a great resource too. 

In researching this post, I discovered LaToya has another podcast [LaToya Builds an App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/latoya-builds-an-app/id1289059517?mt=2) which I'm now going to check out too.

## Device I'm Loving

A few weeks ago I picked up an [Instant Pot](https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/dp/B00FLYWNYQ?tag={{site.amazon_affiliate_id}}) pressure cooker. This pressure cooker has been on my list for a year+ but I kept missing out when it was on sale. So I set up a [Camel Camel Camel alert](https://camelcamelcamel.com/Instant-Pot-Multi-Use-Programmable-Pressure/product/B00FLYWNYQ) and snagged it for $20 off the normal retail price. I have cooked two pot roasts in it and I can now recommend it. :thumbsup: 

I used my [Field Skillet](https://fieldcompany.com/), which I Kickstarted a few years ago, to sear both sides of the meat which is the way to go. I used the Instant Pot to sear one of the roasts, but an iron skillet is a much better way to go.

This weekend I'm going to try out a few soup recipes.

## Recipe I'm Loving

I tried out these recipes [Pressure Cooker Pot Roast](https://www.pressurecookrecipes.com/pressure-cooker-pot-roast/) and [Fall-Apart Pressure Cooker Pot Roast](http://healinggourmet.com/healthy-recipes/fall-apart-pressure-cooker-pot-roast/) and both turned out wonderfully.

The second recipe is a quick and easy recipe goto if you are short on time or only want to use a few ingredients. 

## Bonus: Show I’m Going to Binge Watch This Weekend

[Stranger Things](https://www.netflix.com/title/80057281) season two is out! I loved the first season and I’m going to queue this up to watch while I take care of my almost eight-week-old son.
