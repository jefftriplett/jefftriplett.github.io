Commentary
----------

The biggest changes for me this year were the addition of more AI tooling like coding assistants, VibeTunnel, and the MacWhisper voice translating app. A year ago, I was writing my own AI coding tools with Python. Today, I use voice-to-text to interact with multiple coding assistants that I can access from any browser connected to my Tailscale Tailnet. It’s a mouthful to explain, but coding looks very different now than it did a year or two ago for me.

I’m not using Google Apps as much as I was a few years ago, though I still need to switch between Google Orgs for work and community organizations.

Changes from 2024
-----------------

**New Additions:**

- AI Coding Assistant (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, Codex)
- **VibeTunnel** for accessing my terminal through any browser on my Tailnet
- I started using **Ghostty** to run my AI sessions, but I find its lack of find (⌘f) support to be terribly frustrating.
- I have used MacWhisper for years, but now it’s a daily driver. I can hold down the globe (fn) key on my keyboard and talk to my computer and quickly reply to people or even write blog posts with my voice. It’s incredibly cool and powerful.

**Apps Removed:**

- I dropped **Polypane** (Browser category)
- I managed to not use **Overcast** (Podcasts category) for most of the year, but I’m still not happy with Apple’s Podcast app. I might be switching back.
